# Endless--Runner

This was a challange to my self how fast I could manage to make a simple endless runner. This game took me around 3 hours to
finnish. I wanted to use the basics I learned from my last game and implement them into a simple endless runner.

Game Mechanics-
  -Player is constantly moving upwards at a angle
  -Player can swap between 2 angles using the space bar
  -Pre made obstacles generate infront of player in radnom pattern, this was achieved by putting premade objects into
  an array and than have a random number genarator decide which object will spawn
  -These obstacles also get destroyed after they leave the screen to avoid any performance issues
  -The score at the top is how many seconds the player has managed to survive
 
 Improvements for next time-
  -Have score correspond how many obstacles played avoided
  -Have the score saved and show high score
  -The game should increase in speed and dificulty over time
